## The Odin Project - Weather App

Project completed as part of The Odin Project. A weather app where users can search for the weather in a city. The app displays current weather, current weather details, and a 5-day forecast.

## Languages/Technologies used:
 - Javascript/HTML/CSS
 - VS Code
 - Git/Github
 - ESLint
 - Webpack
 - ES6 Modules
 - NPM
 - Weather API
 - Date-fns library

## What I learned:
 - More about asynchronous functions, how to use promises with async/await
 - How to fetch and utilize data from the Weather API (https://www.weatherapi.com/)

## Still can improve:
 - Could add toggle between Fahrenheit or Celsius
 - Could add additional weather information - hourly forecast, etc.
 - API key security (not concerned about it for this app)
